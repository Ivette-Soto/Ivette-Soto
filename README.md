<b>Hi!</b>   ヽ(✿ﾟ▽ﾟ)ノ

<br>🐒 <b>I’m @Ivette-Soto,</b>

<br>   ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ʖ   listening at port Chile and currently learning JavaScript 😳 in Node.js at {Desafío} Latam_
<br>

☝🏻 So far I've been practicing basic Front-End elemental skills using first HTML5 and CSS.
❣ Back-End has proven to be a tough, but wonderfully engaging challenge.
<br>

🙈🙉🙊
- ✍🏼 No-coding hours are always well spent as testified in verse by  <a href="https://www.clmdd.org/poes%C3%ADa">Círculo Literario Manuel Durán Díaz</a>
- 🤝🏼 See what my hometown is all about through the eyes of  <a href="https://www.elwachyman.cl/">El Wachyman</a>

<br>🐵 Learning progress will be presented in this platform so it'll be available for comments as I'm just beggining the journey into my first code language and advice on how not to end the world while pressing keys over here will be welcomed ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
